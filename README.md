######BootChamp 2: a menubar app for BootCamping
****************************************

***BootChamp 2 is currently in beta.. We're still working out the kinks, so be careful.***

BootChamp 2 is a **menubar app for fast rebooting**. 
It's a spiritual successor to the original BootChamp, which was an amazing tool until it's untimely demise in the Fall of 2014. This revised version allows you to reboot with one click once agan, but does utilise private frameworks, so your mileage may vary.

=============
Main Features
=============

* Extremely fast reboot time
* Completely rebuilt codebase (in Swift!)
* Proper UEFI support
* No administrator access required
* Fully sandboxed
* Mac OS X 10.11+ supported


============
Installation
============


When installing **BootChamp 2** you have two options:

1. Compile the project from source.
2. Download the binary [here](builds/v1.zip)!

It's that easy, just pick a method and you'll be rebooting in seconds.
